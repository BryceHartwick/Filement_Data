Blending a mixture of plant-based materials and polymers creates HATCHBOX 3D Printer's PLA, making this material more Nature-friendly. Because of the lower melting temperatures and lack of warping, PLA filaments retain their color vibrancy and are a common choice for displays or small household prints.
